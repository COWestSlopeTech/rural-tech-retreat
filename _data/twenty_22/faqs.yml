- question: If I can only come for one day which day should that be?
  answer: Saturday is the main event but if you can only come Sunday you would still have fun if you are more interested in hanging out with people in the mountains.

- question: Do I need to purchase a ticket to attend just for a day (no overnight)?
  answer: Yes please purchase a Saturday pass for the main event. We are charging to cover the basic cost of the event so every bit is important.
